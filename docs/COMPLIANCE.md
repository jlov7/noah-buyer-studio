# Compliance Notes

## TREC ยง535.17 Disclosure
This represents an estimated sale price for this property. It is not the same as the opinion of value in an appraisal developed by a licensed appraiser under the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice.

The app injects this disclosure under price content and appends it in generated summaries that reference price.

## Schools
Use neutral language and link families to objective resources such as TXSchools/TEA. Avoid subjective ratings or labels.

## MLS/NAR Note
Before touring, many MLSs now require a written buyer agreement; broker compensation is not displayed in the MLS and is negotiated outside the MLS.
